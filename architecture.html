Architecture
</h1>
<h2>
Overview
</h2>
<pre>
    The Wizards of the Nether's project is to create a Minecraft Mod with several components:
    The overall idea of the mod is to add tabletop role-playing-game elements to the game, Minecraft.
    In order to do this, we are using a pre-built modification library called Forge (minecraftforge.net).
    Forge allows for people to make minecraft mods as far as their documentation will permit.

<h2>
Key Architectural Drivers
</h2>
<pre>
    Requirements for our system:
        Our system relies on being able to access Forge libraries, and relies 
        on having both Forge and Minecraft installed in order to test or use our product. 
        
        Both Minecraft and Forge natively use a client / server architecture in publishing their products.  
</pre>
<h2>
Architectural Style Choices
</h2>
<pre>
    P2P (Peer to Peer)
        For a single player world in Minecraft™, a server is made on the client computer, and 
        technically makes it a P2P connection
        Reason it was considered:
            We thought that this would be the closest architecture that wasn’t Client-Server.
            
    Client-Server
        A server is always setup in Minecraft™, and the player(s) acts as the client(s) accessing the server.
        Reason why we chose this architecture
        Both Forge and Minecraft™ is natively setup to run with this architecture

<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>
<pre>
    In conclusion, we chose a client-server architecture for our program because it is so similar 
    and parallel to what Minecraft and Forge already use. 

    Risk: When Forge updates, it will likely also throw a wrench in our development as well. 
    We would have to decide to either update our source code to keep up, or put a 
    disclaimer telling users which exact version of Forge to use.
