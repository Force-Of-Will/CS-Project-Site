<h2> 1. Component Testing </h2>
<pre>
    Our project thus far has major components, and while testing them separately is not
    necessarily easier than just testing the whole system, there are ways to tell if
    our code will compile.
    
    In eclipse, because we have imported the whole entire minecraft environment and the
    forge environment, the compiler will warn if any of our code is blatantly incorrect. 
    
    The nice thing about the environment we have is that if one thing is not working it
    will not directly effect wether or not other elements of our system will work.
    
    For example, thus far we have daggers and a class selection item. We were able to
    test them separately, but it took so much longer than necessary considering the two 
    components do not interact at all. 
    
    The only interaction between components thus far is between the daggers and 
    the backstab procedure, but if the backstab procedure were completely removed, 
    the daggers would still work, just not the backstab procedure attached to them.
    
    The biggest unit testing tool available to us was the premade gradle build option.
    With this option, we are able to put our whole project into a JAR file and then 
    put said file into the forge Minecraft environment for testing.
    
    We preform component testing extremely routinely in the development of our project. 
    The moment a file exists within the testing space of our project it can be tested
    using the premade gradle executions.
</pre>
<h2> 2. System Testing </h2>
<pre>
    Our system testing method is similar to our unit testing tool. The Gradle executions
    that were premade for our project are able to provide feedback should it exist.
    
    Using gradle, we are able to export our whole system, components and all into a 
    single JAR file, which can then be placed in our Minecraft Forge environment and 
    tested by the user.
    
    The biggest and most useful system testing tool comes as no suprise, with gradle 
    being able to make our JAR files and launchable using the Forge environment, it 
    is such a wonderful testing tool.
    
    We preform System Testing very routinely in our project, mostly because system
    testing is one of the few ways we are able to make sure our code works-- by
    actually messing around with our components and their interactions. 
</pre>
<h2> 3. Acceptance Testing </h2>
<pre>
    In driving our acceptance of components, we used our Acceptance Test Criteria in
    our User Stories to determine wether or not to accept each component. 
    
    <a href="https://jaymay284.github.io/CS-Project-Site/userstories.html">User Stories</a></p>
    
    While not all User Stories will be met with completion, it was mostly a battle 
    of prioritization in finishing some of the most keystone components and ideas of
    our mod, such as a class selection, and perks for each class.
    
    Story 1, Acceptance: NOT ACCEPTED
    Reason: Due to prioritization, we put mana and spell casting on hold in case there
    was extra time towards the end of the semester.
    
    <a href="https://jaymay284.github.io/CS-Project-Site/userstories.html">Story 1</a></p>
    Story 2, Acceptance: NOT ACCEPTED
    Reason: Armor enchantments have not been added as of yet.
    
    <a href="https://jaymay284.github.io/CS-Project-Site/userstories.html">Story 2</a></p>
    Story 3, Acceptance: PASS
    Reason: Forge mod JAR file works on a multiplayer server provided by forge.
    
    <a href="https://jaymay284.github.io/CS-Project-Site/userstories.html">Story 3</a></p>
    Story 4, Acceptance: PASS
    Reason: User is able to select a class that might cater to their individual playstyle.
    
    <a href="https://jaymay284.github.io/CS-Project-Site/userstories.html">Story 4</a></p>
    Story 5, Acceptance: PASS
    Reason: Player is able to select their class with a GUI / item provided to them upon
    first loading into game.
    
    <a href="https://jaymay284.github.io/CS-Project-Site/userstories.html">Story 5</a></p>
    Story 6, Acceptance: PARTIAL ACCEPTANCE
    Reason: Player scaling is a typical part of minecraft, our mod simply adds 
    on to that experience.
    
    <a href="https://jaymay284.github.io/CS-Project-Site/userstories.html">Story 6</a></p>
    Story 7, Acceptance: PASS
    Reason: Computer performance is not effected compared to original minecraft in any way,
    shape, or form. Performance is impacted by mod within +-5% performance.
    
    <a href="https://jaymay284.github.io/CS-Project-Site/userstories.html">Story 7</a></p>
    Story 8, Acceptance: MAJORITY PASS
    Reason: While the mod is different from other ideas and mods that already exist, it is
    pretty much impossible to deal with the endless possibilities of mods that might already
    exist, or will exist in the future, our mod aims at using standalone components, making
    crossover with other mods significantly unlikely.
    
    <a href="https://jaymay284.github.io/CS-Project-Site/userstories.html">Story 8</a></p>
    Story 9, Acceptance: PARTIAL PASS
    Reason: We have not yet worked on this yet, but it currently works due to there being
    zero conflict whatsoever. Server performance, startup, and machine longevity is 
    uneffected.
    
    <a href="https://jaymay284.github.io/CS-Project-Site/userstories.html">Story 9</a></p>
    Story 10, Acceptance: PASS
    Reason: While forge continues to support current outlining and documentation / library
    support, this mod will continue to work in later forge versions.
