<h1> Design </h1>
<pre>
    Our project uses the Forge framework, which allows modifications to be added to Minecraft
through the use of class files representing mod elements to the game environment.
<h2>
Architecture Diagram
</h2>
    Our architexture diagram shows that the Minecraft server works in tandem with the forge server/
client which can be interfaced to users. The forge client then is the "final" product that is then 
displayed to the user(s) in a modded Minecraft environment.

<h2>
Class-Level Design
</h2>
    Each mod "element" has its own java class file and some even have 2 files to "bus" multiple 
elements into the mod environment all at once. For the most part, though, all mod elements have 
separate class files and are all tied together in two class files that actually put all the
mod elements in one place.

    Our two main class files that tie every element together are our "Mod" and "Mod Elements"
files. 
Mod:
    Controls data values used in the mod. This can be anything from global "mod-id" element
to version values. This file also kind of "wraps up" all the finished elements and 
keeps them all in once place.

Mod Elements:
    This file wraps together each element that references it. Each "bus" delivers different
types of elements. Biomes, items, GUIs, Enchantments, etc. 

<h2>
Control-Issues
</h2>
    The good thing about our system's design is that all elements are pretty much independent 
from one-another. If one element is buggy, then we know exactly where to look in our code.
There are no external-influences that would directly change our code other than us actually
going in and changing it for ourselves. 

    All elements are very separate form one another. For example, the daggers show no presence 
in the GUI / screen file, the execute mechanic will not show up in the GUI file. If one element
shows signs of issues, we pretty much know exactly where to look in order to go and fix the issue.
