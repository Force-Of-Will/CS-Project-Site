    who want to explore other options to add to their gaming experience. For players who 
    are specifically interested in tabletop RPG game elements, such as cleric healers,
    roguelike assassins, and bruiser warriors. Should time provide, we will also be
    adding a mage class to the mod as well.

    only be added should time allow at the end of the semester.

2. General Description of Product
</h2>
<pre> 
    2.1 Context of Product
    Our mod is created in a Java environment created by Forge Development LLC. It uses Gradle
    technologies to compile all features of the lab together into a single, executable JAR file.
    This JAR file can then be placed in your 'mods' folder in any Minecraft Forge environment 
    and will show in game.

    2.2 Domain Model with Description
    Display and describe your domain model.

    2.3 Product Functions (general)
    When compiled together as a JAR file, the mod can then be placed into any Forge environment,
    then grabbed by the game environment to be used in-game. Once the mod JAR file is placed
    in an active environment, there is no need to enable or disable it, it is enabled by default.

    2.4 User Characteristics and Expectations
    It is expected for the user to have a legitimately-obtained copy of Minecraft: Java Edition
    and for the user to be able to install Forge on their own or with help.

    2.5 Constraints
    Describe any constraints on your system.

    2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
    Our system assumes the user has Minecraft: Java and Forge installed. This whole project

    to execute and run the mod. System requirements as listed per forge and Mojang guidelines
    are required as well.
