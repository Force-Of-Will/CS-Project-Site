    1.1 Purpose of Product
        The purpose of this product is to provide a modified Minecraft environment to players 
        who want to explore other options to add to their gaming experience. For players who 
        are specifically interested in tabletop RPG game elements, such as cleric healers,
        roguelike assassins, and bruiser warriors. Should time provide, we will also be
        adding a mage class to the mod as well.

    1.2 Scope of Product
        Mod adds tabletop gaming elements to Minecraft. Includes a cleric class, an assassin 
        class, and a tanky warrior class. This will not include all elements typically 
        experienced in a tabletop RPG session, and as stated before, the mage  
        class will only be added should time allow at the end of the semester.

2. General Description of Product
</h2>
<pre> 
    2.1 Context of Product
        Our mod is created in a Java environment created by Forge Development LLC. It uses Gradle
        technologies to compile all features of the lab together into a single, executable JAR file.
        This JAR file can then be placed in your 'mods' folder in any Minecraft Forge environment 
        and will show in game.

    2.2 Domain Model with Description
        <a href="https://jaymay284.github.io/CS-Project-Site/Domain_Model.png">Domain Model</a></p>
        Our domain model shows the flow and scope of our project. 
        Using the built-in gradle function Forge provides, we can make a compilable jar file 
        which will then interface in-game. Our mod will include 3 different RPG classes, 
        and different items and / or mechanics for each class (outlined by lines in our DM diagram.)        

    2.3 Product Functions (General)
        When compiled together as a JAR file, the mod can then be placed into any Forge environment,
        then grabbed by the game environment to be used in-game. Once the mod JAR file is placed
        in an active environment, there is no need to enable or disable it, it is enabled by default.

    2.4 User Characteristics and Expectations
        It is expected for the user to have a legitimately-obtained copy of Minecraft: Java Edition
        and for the user to be able to install Forge on their own or with help.

    2.5 Constraints
        Our system must work with existing game mechanics in Minecraft. It should also be balanced
        so that none of the classes are significantly outperformed.

    2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
        Our system assumes the user has Minecraft: Java and Forge installed. This whole project
        revolves around having Minecraft version 1.15.2 and Forge version 31.2.0 installed. Java 
        is required as well in order to execute and run the mod. System requirements as listed 
        per Forge and Mojang guidelines are required as well.
