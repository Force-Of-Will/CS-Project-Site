<h1> Problem Statement</h1>
<pre> 
    The Wizards of the Nether's project is to create a Minecraft Mod with several components:
    The overall idea of the mod is to add tabletop role-playing-game elements to the game, Minecraft.
    In order to do this, we are using a pre-built modification library called Forge (minecraftforge.net).
    Forge allows for people to make minecraft mods as far as their documentation will permit.
    
    Because the game, Minecraft is written in Java, we estimate most, if not all of our code will also be written in Java.
    For this project, we can download the Forge libraries and implement them on our own machines to be used in our IDE's.
    
    The purpose of this project is to learn about Minecraft libraries and how to implement them in a modded environment. 
    As far as scope goes for this project, we have a few ideas that we want to do for sure, or at least attempt to make:
        -Add tabletop roleplay game elements to the game of Minecraft.
            •GUI to choose class at start of game. (Per-player) 
            •Classes
                ♦Healer / Cleric
                    ○ ++Passive Heal / Instant Health
                ♦Fighter / Warrior
                    ○ ++Strength buffs (resistance / armor)

                    ○ New set of tools. (Damage dealing weapons / tools) ++Durability
                    ○ Extra damage from behind mobs. ++Backstab
                    ○ Invisibility (Temporary)
                    ○ Dagger + Recipe 
                ♦Wizard
                    ○ (On-Hold at this moment.)
                    ○ Wand per ability
            •Per-Class tools
                ♦Only members of a certain class-type can use certain items.
    Terms that may be useful to know in this project:
        Mod: In terms of a game, an add-on or modification to how a game is played, which can add new challenges, or other gameplay elements.
        Healer / Cleric: In an RPG game, a mythical character who can 'heal' her allies by some sort of magical power, or someone skilled in the healing arts.
        Fighter / Warrior: One skilled in the art of fighting, might last slightly longer in fights than other characters.
        Roguelike / Assassin: A character who is extremely skilled in a lot of damage up front, might last slightly shorter time in combat because of low defenses.
