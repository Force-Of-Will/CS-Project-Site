<h2> Story 1 </h2>
<pre>
    As a player, I want to have a mana system implemented for caster classes so that it won't be as much as a hassle 
    to use those class abilities.

    Elaboration: I feel it would be a pain to look for the item/items needed to perform the 
    spell effect.

    Constraints: None

    Effort Estimation: 1 person-hours

    Acceptance Test: Having the spell effect tied to a key bind and not an item, 
    without allowing it to be spammed indefinitely.
</pre>
<h2> Story 2 </h2>
<pre>
    As a player, I want to have more armor enchantments and damage types so that there can 
    be a bit more strategy when it comes to dealing with mobs.

    Elaboration: Certain mobs should deal something different from default damage (i.e. spiders should do poison damage 
    and wither skeletons should do necrotic damage). To combat this, different armor enchantments could be added to gain 
    resistance to these damage types. You could add stuff like a "thorns" effect to armor as well.

    Constraints: none

    Effort Estimation: 10 person-hours

    Acceptance Test: Spiders do poison damage and poison resistance will reduce this damage and/or wither skeletons 
    will do necrotic damage and necrotic resistance will reduce this damage.
