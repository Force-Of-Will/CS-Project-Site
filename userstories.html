<h2> Story 1 </h2>
<pre>
    As a player, I want to have a mana system implemented for caster classes so that it won't be as much as a hassle to use those class abilities.

    Elaboration: I feel it would be a pain to look for the item/items needed to perform the spell effect.

    Constraints: None

    Effort Estimation: 1 person-hours

    Acceptance Test: Having the spell effect tied to a key bind and not an item, without allowing it to be spammed indefinitely.
</pre>
<h2> Story 2 </h2>
<pre>
    As a player, I want to have more armor enchantments and damage types so that there can be a bit more strategy when it comes to dealing with mobs.

    Elaboration: Certain mobs should deal something different from default damage (i.e. spiders should do poison damage and wither skeletons should do necrotic damage). To combat this, different armor enchantments could be added to gain resistance to these damage types. You could add stuff like a "thorns" effect to armor as well.

    Constraints: none

    Effort Estimation: 10 person-hours

    Acceptance Test: Spiders do poison damage and poison resistance will reduce this damage and/or wither skeletons will do necrotic damage and necrotic resistance will reduce this damage.
</pre>
<h2> Story 3 </h2>
<pre>
    As a third-party server owner, I want to be able to use this mod on a multiplayer server.
    
    Elaboration: Classes are independent to-player, each player can go on their own path in the game. Mod works and is executable on multiplayer servers.
    
    Constraints: Independant data storage, or metadata per-player. (Serverside handling is done by forge itself.)
    
    Effort Estimation: 30 minutes -> 2 person-hours.
    
    Acceptance Test: Mod runs on a server-environment, players are individual classes to one-another.
